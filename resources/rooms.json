    "story_intro": "\tYou are an investigator for the _Veracia _Homicide _Department. Thanks to magic cutting edge technology, you are able to enter the mind of suspects when necessary to gather evidence. \n\tOn July 24th, a body was found on the beach just outside of city limits. A dinghy was found washed ashore about a hundred meters down the beach from the body. While an autopsy found the cause of death to be drowning, the body has several bruises and a black eye. It seems as though they suffered a head injury before death.",
    "police_report": "\n\tThe body was identified as ~Theodore ~Zephyr, a twenty one year old Veracian native who graduated from _Veracia _University this past May. He was last seen on his friend and classmate `Joseph `Acker's boat around midnight. Reportedly, the two boys fought before ~Mr. ~Zephyr, and the dinghy, disappeared from the boat. It is unknown whether ~Mr. ~Zephyr took the dinghy by choice or if foul play was involved. Since hearing of his friend's death, `Mr. `Acker has been in a catatonic state. Your job is to enter his mind and find out what really happened that fateful July night. \n\nYou have entered `Joseph's mind, which is organized like a castle.",
