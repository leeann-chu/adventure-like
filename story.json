    "story_intro": "\tYou are an investigator for the Veracia Homicide Department. Thanks to magic cutting edge technology, you are able to enter the mind of suspects when necessary to gather evidence. \n\tOn July 24th, a body was found on the beach just outside of city limits. A dinghy was found washed ashore about a hundred meters down the beach from the body. While an autopsy found the cause of death to be drowning, the body has several bruises and a black eye. It seems as though they suffered a head injury before death.",
    "police_report": "\n\tThe body was identified as Theodore Zephyr, a twenty one year old Veracian native who graduated from Veracia University this past May. He was last seen on his friend and classmate Joseph Acker's boat around midnight. Reportedly, the two boys fought before Theodore, and the dinghy, disappeared from the boat. It is unknown whether Theodore took the dinghy by choice or if foul play was involved. Since hearing of his friend's death, Joseph has been in a catatonic state. Your job is to enter his mind and find out what really happened that fateful July night. \n\nYou have entered Joseph's mind, which is organized like a castle.",
    "gate_entrance": "The portcullis slams shut behind you! You stand in a courtyard. The front door of the castle towers above you. You can reach the door handle, but there is also a doorbell.",
    "doorbell": "You stand in the grand entry hall of the castle. A draft blows through the castle, carrying these words: \"Wow! You are so polite! Here is a compass to help you on your travels as a token of appreciation!\" A Compass falls from the ceiling and into your hands.",
    "door_handle": "You stand in the grand entry hall of the castle. You are greeted by an empty silence. An extravagant stairway leads further into the castle.",
    "tapestries": "The floor is covered by a lush blue rug. Four unique tapestries cover the walls, depicting scenes from various franchises. A grand chandelier hangs from the ceiling.\nA man stands before two suns holding a sword of light.\n A boy raises a lightning bolt above his head as he stands atop the Empire State Building. \nA man in a metal suit flies over a city of skyscrapers. \nThis tapestry is charred beyond recognition.",
    "throneroom": "You arrive at the top of the stairs. You are in the throne room. The throne is made of swords. It is empty. Several pathways branch off from here.",
    "throneroom_look": "You smell sweet aromas from the north \nYou hear a distant whistle from the east \nThe west is silent."
